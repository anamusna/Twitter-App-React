## [2.0.1] - 2017-07-07
###Â Fixed
- Fixed bug (thank you @linayanse)

## [2.0.0] - 2017-07-02
### Changed
- `styled-map` now looks for a "default" key if there are no matches. Otherwise it will use the last item in the map as in previous versions.

### Added
- Sometimes you want to use the value of a prop instead of its name, like `<Button type="primary" />`. You can use `styled-map` this way by providing a string as the first argument. E.g., `styledMap('type', { ... })`.
